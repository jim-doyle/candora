Installing and Using the Candora Core Java Native CAN Adapter for Linux

0.  Read and understand the License that this is provided under. Understand the risks and hazards of
    of attaching to a CAN bus in an industrial or automative product.

1.  Download the Candora core JAR file and the native shared library file appropriate for your
machine architecture of your JVM (armv7, x86_64, or mips)

2.  If using Maven, and you are not using a artifact repository, then locally deploy the JAR maven artifact
as follows. This will allow your IDE and build tooling to pickup the depedency.

    <groupId>org.ab1rw</groupId>
    <artifactId>candora</artifactId>
    <artifactId>core</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

2. Invoke your JVM as follows

java -Djava.library.path=candora-core.so  -cp candora-core-1.0.0.jar;other jar;other jar;...  com.company.package.YourMainClass

alternatively,
set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:candora-core.so

finally, you could also install the shared object in your Linux

3. Logger and Debugging
Candora uses JUL (java.util.Logger) logging.  If you are using another logger framework, i.e. slf4j, then you should
read up on and setup the appropriate jul-proxy.
Candora will log at the SEVERE, INFO and FINE levels

4. Diagnosis and Troubleshooting
