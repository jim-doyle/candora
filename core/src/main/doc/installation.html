<h2>Features</h2>
<li>An engineered, best-practices GPL solution using Java Exceptions, JUL Logging, Immutable objects with Bounds and Range checks,
    thread-safety, C++ namespaces, Maven project packaging, JUnit tests, Javadoc.</li>
<li>Provides decode of CAN Error events and treats them as a message subtype for flexible bus health monitoring.</li>
<li>Extends and enhances to Unix socket API to provide cleaner encapsulation and stronger types.</li>
<li>Promiscous raw receive mode to facilitate implementation of CAN gateway, router and sniffer applications in Java.</li>
<li>Filtered receive mode to support small, embedded control programs on Linux hosts.</li>
<li>Blocking read, blocking read with timeout, and non-block poll modes on receive.</li>
<li>Uses Java Native Interface and thin layer of C++ adapter code to access Linux SocketCAN API directly.</li>
<li>Free of memory leaks and concurrency hazards.</li>

<h2>Tested with</h2>
<li>MCP2515 based controller pair : jARDCAN (Arduino) - PiCAN (Raspberry Pi 3)</li>
<li>Oracle JRE bundled with Raspian</li>

<h2>Future</h2>
<li>Test againt MCP2517FD Controllers (when available)</li>
<li>Test and publish binaries for MIPS and x86_64</li>

<h2>Installing and Using the Candora Core Java Native CAN Adapter for Linux</h2>

0.  Read and understand the License that this is provided under. Understand the risks and hazards of
    of attaching to a CAN bus in an industrial or automative product and possibly threats to life, limb and
    property.

1.  Download the Candora core JAR file and the native shared library file appropriate for your
machine architecture of your JVM (armv7, x86_64, or mips)

2.  If using Maven, and you are not using a artifact repository, then locally deploy the JAR maven artifact
as follows:
This will allow your IDE and build tooling to pickup the depedency.
<pre>
    $ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=core-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -DpomFile=pom.xml
</pre>
<pre>
    <groupId>org.ab1rw</groupId>
    <artifactId>core</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</pre>

3. Install the Java Native Shared Library on the host where your CAN hardware is located. In this case, we will
install it in the global, trusted shared library directories.
<pre>
    $ sudo cp libcandora-jni.so /usr/lib
    $ sudo /sbin/ldconfig -v
</pre>

4. Invoke your JVM as follows

java -Djava.library.path=candora-core.so  -cp candora-core-1.0.0.jar;other jar;other jar;...  com.company.package.YourMainClass

alternatively,
set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:candora-core.so

finally, you could also install the shared object in your Linux

3. Logger and Debugging

Candora uses JUL (java.util.Logger) logging available in any JRE.  It will log at the following levels ;
SEVERE for non-continuable configuration problems. WARN if an Error frame is received and if error packet reception
is enabled. INFO for expected, high-level milestones in the course of normal operation. FINE for detailed debugging
including entry and return from the C++ native layer.

If you are using another logger framework, i.e. slf4j, then you should read up on and setup the appropriate jul-proxy.

4. Diagnosis and Troubleshooting

<h2>Building from Source</h2>
Maven packaging vastly simplifies the build process for the Java components. The JNI layer is built from a Makefile.
You may need to edit the Makefile to point it to your JDK's headers, as well as modify compiler or link flags.
The Makefile provided worked to build a JNI shared library for ARM on the Raspbian platform.
<pre>
    $ cd candora/core
    $ mvn -DskipTests=true clean package
    $ cd ../nativeapi/src/main/cxx
    $ make clean all
</pre>

* CAN is a broadcast-only bus with a source address (but no dest address) and the address ID
is used for media access prioritization  Further, unlike ethernet, it has strong delivery guarantee semantics.
