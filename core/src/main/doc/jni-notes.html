JNI Programming Notes

A number of JNI programming idioms are demonstrated here:
1.  Accessing a Java byte [] array from C++ ; for read access and to mutate values
2.  Creating a new Java String in C++ and returning it
3.  Throwing a Java exception from C++ code.
4.  Using Class, Field and Accessors to touch a variety of data types (bool, int, String, arrays)
5.  Storing UNIX socket descriptors on a Java instance by using a private int field.


Regarding Memory Allocation
-  Most of our temporary values are allocated on the stack by the compiler. THis is because UNIX system calls
are blocking and synchronous, so deallocation occurs implicitly when the stack unwinds.
-  We use JNI allocation for strings and arrays.
